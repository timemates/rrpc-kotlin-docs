# Implementation Details
If you're interested, how rRPC works internally, but don't want to browse code, this section is for you.

## Metadata
As you already know, code is generated and then serialized using ProtoBuf. In RSocket requests, there's two parts that
is sent/received: metadata and data. If we already know what encoded in the data (it's actually type specified in schema),
in metadata we encode the following:
```
message ClientMetadata {
    int32 schemaVersion = 1;
    string serviceName = 2;
    string procedureName = 3;
    map<string, bytes> extra = 4;
}

message ServerMetadata {
    int32 clientMetadata = 1;
    map<string, bytes> extra = 2;
}
```

Let's dive into `ClientMetadata`:
- `schemaVersion`: version of the schema, for compatibility purposes only (for now unused, version = 1).
- `serviceName`: fully qualified name from `.proto` file â€“ package name + service name
- `procedureName`: name of the rpc in the scheme.
- `extra`: custom metadata to be passed to server/client by interceptors and so on.

For `ServerMetadata` it's the same.

## Requests
There's five types of requests in RSocket: Request-Response, Request-Stream, Request-Channel, Fire-And-Forget 
and Metadata-Push.

For now, we support only Request-Response, Request-Stream and Request-Channel:

| proto                             | Request Type     |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| `rpc (T) returns (R)`             | Request-Response |
| `rpc (T) returns (stream R)`      | Request-Stream   |
| `rpc(stream T) return (stream R)` | Request-Channel  |

Client-only streaming is not supported by transport (RSocket), so we don't support it either. We may support other
request types by annotation type called `Ack`, here's [an issue](https://github.com/timemates/rrpc/issues/9) to discuss.

That's all what you probably need to know. Implementation is very simple and requires not a many efforts.
