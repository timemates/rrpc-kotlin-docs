# Plans

For now, it's a very beginning and there are a lot of things to be done. Here's our near-future plans:
- Java support (Client & Server) with bridge for Java asynchronous types.
- Pure JavaScript / TypeScript implementation of the library.
- Pure Python implementation of the library.

You can support us by implementing the library using another than Kotlin/Java language. Please visit 
[Implementation Details](Implementation.md) page and contact [us](https://t.me/y9vad9) if you decide to do so.
